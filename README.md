# SESOP and utils

This repository has a working implementation of the SESOP algorithme found in «Sequential Subspace Optimization Method
for Large-Scale Unconstrained Problems» by Narkiss and Zibulevsky. (https://optimization-online.org/2005/10/1235/).

Multiple utils are also implemented, such as a way to use the SESOP with ```linear_least_squares``` models, with precomputed operations for a more efficient image filtering. 

Benchmarking tools are also avaible and tests on multiple ```julia``` problem libraries are implemented.
